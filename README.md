# An Introduction to Optimization Algorithms

[<img alt="Travis CI Build Status" src="https://img.shields.io/travis/thomasWeise/betAndRun/master.svg" height="20"/>](https://travis-ci.org/thomasWeise/aitoa/)

With the book "An Introduction to Optimization Algorithms" I try to provide an introduction in optimization, optimization algorithms, and, in particular, metaheuristics.

The book is available in the following formats:

1. As [pdf](http://thomasweise.github.io/aitoa/aitoa.pdf), for reading on the computer and/or printing, if you must.
2. As stand-alone [html](http://thomasweise.github.io/aitoa/aitoa.html), for reading on any kind of electronic device.
3. As [epub](http://thomasweise.github.io/aitoa/aitoa.epub), for reading on mobile phones or other handheld devices (although the conversion to this format is not yet working nicely).
