# An Introduction to Optimization Algorithms

[<img alt="Travis CI Build Status" src="https://img.shields.io/travis/thomasWeise/betAndRun/master.svg" height="20"/>](https://travis-ci.org/thomasWeise/aitoa/)

With the book "An Introduction to Optimization Algorithms" we try to develop an accessible and easy-to-read introduction to optimization, optimization algorithms, and, in particular, metaheuristics.
The goal is to discuss to develop a general framework structure for optimization problems and then approach algorithms from bottom-up, starting with simple approaches and step-by-step moving to more advanced methods.
These moves are incremental, as problems of the current algorithm are discussed based on real results on a real example application, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem ([JSSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_shop_scheduling)).
Every algorithm is implemented in [Java 1.8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8) and all accompanying sources codes are provided in an additional [GitHub repository](http://github.com/thomasWeise/aitoa-code). 

The book is available in the following formats:

1. as [pdf](http://thomasweise.github.io/aitoa/aitoa.pdf), for reading on the computer and/or printing (but please don't print this, save paper),
2. as [html](http://thomasweise.github.io/aitoa/aitoa.html), for reading in the browser,  and
3. as [epub](http://thomasweise.github.io/aitoa/aitoa.epub), for reading on mobile phones or other hand-held devices.
