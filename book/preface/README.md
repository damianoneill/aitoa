# Preface {-}

After I wrote *Global Optimization Algorithms &ndash; Theory and Applications*&nbsp;[@WGOEB] during my time as PhD student more than ten years ago, I now want to write a more direct guide to optimization, optimization algorithms, and metaheuristics.
Currently, this book is in a very early stage of development.
It is work-in-progress, so expect many changes.

This book is written using my automated book writing environment, which integrates [GitHub](http://www.github.com), [Travis CI](http://www.travis-ci.org), and [docker](http://www.docker.com)-[hub](http://hub.docker.com).
Basically, I write the book in my repository *[aitoa](http://github.com/thomasWeise/aitoa)* at GitHub.
There, you can also submit [issues](http://github.com/thomasWeise/aitoa/issues), which can be change requests, suggestions, discovered bugs or typos, or maybe inform me that something is unclear, so that I can improve the book.
Whenever I make a change to the book, maybe resulting from your submitted issue, new versions will automatically be built.
The build process is described at <http://iao.hfuu.edu.cn/blogs/157>.
