# Introduction

Today, algorithms influence a bigger and bigger part in our daily life and the economy.
They support us by recommending good decisions in a variety of fields, ranging from engineering, time scheduling, product design, over travel and logistic planning to even product or movie recommendations.
They will be the most important element of the transition of our industry to smarter manufacturing and intelligent production, where they will automate a variety of tasks, as illustrated in [@fig:intelligent_manufacturing].

![Examples for applications of optimization, computational intelligence, machine learning techniques in five fields of smart manufacturing: the production itself, the delivery of the products, the management of the production, the products and services, and the sales level.](\relative.path{intelligent_manufacturing.svgz}){#fig:intelligent_manufacturing width=99%}

Optimization and Operations Research provide us with algorithms that propose good solutions to such a wide variety of questions.
Usually, these solutions minimize (at least) one resource requirement.
The unique advantage of this is that resources that minimize resource consumption are often not only cheaper from an immediate economic perspective, but also better for the environment, i.e., with respect to ecological considerations.

But how can algorithms help us making good decisions?
How can they help us to save resources?
In this book, we will explore techniques from the field of optimization, we will look at algorithms and examples, in order to answer these questions.
