# Why is optimization difficult?

So far, we have learned quite a lot of optimization algorithms.
These algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses.
We have gathered some experience in solving optimization problems.
Some optimization problems are hard to solve, some are easy.
Actually, sometimes there are *instances* of the same problem that are harder than others.
It is natural to ask what makes an optimization problem hard for a given algorithm.
