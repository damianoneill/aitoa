# Appendix {#sec:appendix}

It is my goal to make this book easy to read and fast to understand.
This goal somehow conflicts with two other goals, namely those of following a clear, abstract, and unified structure as well as being very comprehensive.
Unfortunately, we cannot have all at once.
Therefore, I choose to sometimes just describe some issues from the surface perspective and dump the details into this appendix.
