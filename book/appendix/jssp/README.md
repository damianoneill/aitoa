## Job Shop Scheduling Problen {#sec:appendix:jssp}

The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is used as leading example to describe the structure of optimization in [@sec:structure] and then serves again as application and experiment example when introducing the different metaheuristic algorithms in [@sec:metaheuristics].
