## The Solution Space

Per \text.ref{optimizationProblemEconomical}, an optimization problem forces us to make a choice between different potential solutions.

\text.block{definition}{candidateSolution}{A *candidate solution*&nbsp;$\sespel$ is one potential solution of an optimization problem.}

\text.block{definition}{solutionSpace}{The *solution space*&nbsp;$\solutionSpace$ of an optimization problem is the set of all of its candidate solutions&nbsp;$\sespel\in\solutionSpace$.}
