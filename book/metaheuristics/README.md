# Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms {#sec:metaheuristics}

[Metaheuristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic)&nbsp;[@WGOEB; @GP2010HOM; @GK2003HOM] are algorithms that can solve general optimization problems.
In this chapter, we will introduce several such algorithms and explore them, by using again the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) from [@sec:jsspExample] as example.
We will directly build upon the concepts that we have introduced in [@sec:structure].
